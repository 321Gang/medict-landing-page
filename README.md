## Installation Instruction
### Run website locally

Clone this project using `git clone` and open the `index.html` file.

### Deployment

Connect the master branch of this repository to [Digital Ocean App Service](https://www.digitalocean.com/). This service recognizes that this is a static webpage project, so it will automatically deploy `index.html` as the starting page. The page is then available at `https://medict-landing-page-3avds.ondigitalocean.app/`

Purchase a domain, in this case [medict.software](medict.software). Add `https://medict-landing-page-3avds.ondigitalocean.app/` as an `ALIAS` to DNS records of `medict.software`. Upon every commit pushed to master, the deployment will be triggered and changes will be reflected on `medict.software` in a few seconds.
